# 📬 SMS Campaign Response Analysis (Bank Marketing Simulation)

**Author:** Jeremy Gutierrez  
**Tools Used:** SQL (MySQL), Python, Seaborn/Matplotlib, Power BI-ready structure  
**Project Type:** Data Analyst Portfolio  
**Target Role:** AI-Powered Data Analyst at Drips  
**Dataset Source:** UCI Bank Marketing Dataset ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing))

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project simulates the analysis of an SMS outreach campaign to banking customers, modeled after real-world use cases at companies like **Drips**.

The goal is to extract **actionable business insights** using SQL and data visualization, based on historical campaign performance, customer demographics, and behavior patterns.

---

## 📊 Business Questions

1. **Which customer segments respond best to SMS outreach messages?**
2. **How does the timing or frequency of contact affect conversion rate?**
3. **If we can only reach 20% of leads, who should we prioritize?**

## 🧮 SQL Code (MySQL Dialect)

SQL scripts used in this project are stored in the `/sql` folder.

### 📁 Place this content in `/sql/q1_segment_response.sql`
```sql
SELECT
  education,
  job,
  COUNT(*) AS total_contacts,
  SUM(CASE WHEN subscribed = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_responses,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN subscribed = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS response_rate_pct
FROM sms_campaign
GROUP BY education, job
HAVING total_contacts >= 50
ORDER BY response_rate_pct DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 📁 Place this content in `/sql/q2_contact_frequency.sql`
```sql
SELECT
  campaign,
  COUNT(*) AS total_contacts,
  SUM(CASE WHEN subscribed = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_responses,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN subscribed = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS response_rate_pct
FROM sms_campaign
GROUP BY campaign
ORDER BY campaign;
```

### 📁 Place this content in `/sql/q3_top_20_percent.sql`
```sql
WITH segment_rates AS (
  SELECT
    education,
    job,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN subscribed = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS seg_response_rate
  FROM sms_campaign
  GROUP BY education, job
),
scored AS (
  SELECT
    sc.*,
    sr.seg_response_rate
  FROM sms_campaign sc
  JOIN segment_rates sr
    ON sc.education = sr.education
   AND sc.job = sr.job
)
SELECT
  age,
  job,
  education,
  balance,
  seg_response_rate AS estimated_response_pct
FROM scored
ORDER BY estimated_response_pct DESC, balance DESC
LIMIT CEIL((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sms_campaign) * 0.20);
```
